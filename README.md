## DotJava

DotJava is an in-code source code generator for Java. We use DotJava to generate java source code at runtime. This could be for many reasons, but I created it to generate the boilerplate code I don't want to write everytime I create a new project.

### Missing features / Coming Soon
- [ ] Indentation engine for generated code
- [ ] Support for Java 16 record classes
- [ ] Complex annotations
- [ ] Constructor creators for classes and abstract classes
- [ ] Support for Java 16 sealed classes
- [ ] Method instruction support
- [ ] Project file pre-creation (Like .idea folder for IntelliJ)
- Generator code validation
  - [ ] Access modifier validation
  - [ ] Duplicate annotation validation
  - [ ] Duplicate method validation
  - [ ] Duplicate field validation
  - [ ] Duplicate class validation
